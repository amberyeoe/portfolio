            <h4>Project Scope/Client's Problem </h4>
          <p>Task: To design and develop an intuitive hotel web user interface as a team <u>using HTML, CSS and JavaScript</u></p>
          <h4>My Role & Solution </h4>
          <p>Created: <a href="https://letimelesstresor.netlify.app/pages/facilities.html" class="link">Facilities</a> and <a href="https://letimelesstresor.netlify.app/pages/services.html" class="link">Services</a> pages, and Facility booking forms</p>
          <h4>My Work Process</h4>
          <p><b>Planning: </b><br>
            Firstly, we decided on a <u><b>Luxury Vintage Hotel Website</b></u>.
            <br><br>
            My team and I found some <u>competitors to our hotel</u> and did an analysis to find out what features made it good and what could be better to make our website comparable to theirs. We identified Marina Bay Sands and the Shangri-La Resort as <u>prime competitors</u>. 
            We noted that they used sophisticated and consistent colour schemes, and sufficient whitespaces to display a modern and classy look.
            <br><br>
            We proceeded to conduct a survey to see what users expect from our website, considering our vintage theme. With their responses, we created a <u>color palette</u> for our website to have a consistent feel.
            <img src="../resources/colorpalette.jpeg" class="image" alt="">
            <br>
            With our structure settled, I could do my pen and paper prototype to invision what I would like my final website to look like.
            <img src="../resources/prototype.jpg" class="image" alt="">
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Coding: </b>
            <br>
            We created a Git respository and added each other as contributors so that we could all collaborate on the same file. I coded the website on Atom. I also added comments and used descriptive class & ID names so it's easy to understand my codes.
            <img src="../resources/uxd1.jpg" class="image code" alt=""> 
            <br>
            I also added media to make my webpages responsive to the <u>different screen sizes</u>, while remaining the same feel.
          </p>
          <h4>Outcome & Results Achieved</h4>
          <p>
            Finally, with our own complete webpages, we <u>linked up our webpages</u> and did some final checking to make sure our website <u>felt consistent throughout</u>. Feel free to check out our website with the link down below.

          <img src="../resources/srm2.jpg" class="srm-header">
          <h4>Project Scope/Client's Problem </h4>
          <p>You are a group of innovative, creative and energetic young people (The “ICE” Team) who intend to use data-driven analyses to investigate social issues / support better living in the community. As a team, you are to pick a social topic or a current issue, conjecture a main hypothesis and a set of sub-hypotheses, which will be verified or disproven by the analysis. Team members are to verify or disprove 1 sub-hypothesis each, which will contribute to verify or disprove the team’s main hypothesis.
          <br><br><b>Chosen Hypothesis: Singapore is a good country to live in</b></p>
          <h4>My Role & Solution </h4>
          <p>Justify <b>my sub-hypthesis: Singapore has the best healthcare</b></p>
          <h4>My Work Process</h4>
          <p>Firstly, we <u>crafted survey questions</u> about our sub-hypothesis and gathered 120 responses from various age groups. 
            I found secondary datasets that influenced my sub-hypothesis. I focused my research on 3 aspects: <u>Affordability, Efficiency, and Life Expectancy</u>.
            Using my statistical research methods skills learnt, I used <u>hypothesis testing(z-test), confidence interval and regression </u> to analyse the datasets including my survey results. 
            <br>
            <img src="../resources/srm3.jpg" class="research">
            <br>
            After getting a conclusion from my analysis, I had to craft a report to <u>explain my discovery</u>. I found evidences that showed the relationship between the aspects I found and how it affects my sub-hypothesis. 
            For example, to <u>explain why I've chosen life expectancy</u> as an affecting factor. I found out that a good healthcare system will have more healthcare facilities, more highly skilled healthcare
            workers that can treat patients more efficiently, and more up to date resources so that they can <u>readily treat patients</u>, regardless of the complexity of treatment, <u>prolonging
            their residents' life expectancy</u>. And therefore, life expectancy was used as a measure of healthcare quality.
          </p>
          
          <h4>Outcome & Results Achieved</h4>
          <p>Finally, with all the analysis of my data, I could derive a conclusion. I was <u><b>able to justify my sub-hypothesis</b></u> that Singapore had a . After each of us were done with our portion, we gave an overall conclusion on our overarching hypothesis.</p>

          <h4>Project Scope/Client's Problem </h4>
            <p>The team is to gather requirements from the key stakeholder(s) of your choice (who is your potential target user of your solution) to understand the user needs and data visualisation report objectives through a requirements elicitation interview session. The team is also required to document the requirements using the user story approach.
              <br><br> The team is to provide a data-driven solution for the key stakeholder(s) using data visualisation tool (Microsoft Power BI) by applying ETL techniques, visualisation techniques and statistical modelling techniques.</p>
            <p><b>Hypothesis: Singapore is a good place to live and work in.</b></p>
          <h4>My Role & Solution </h4>
            <p><b>Problem Statement chosen: Singapore has a good healthcare system</b></p>
          <h4>My Work Process</h4>
            <p><b>Business understanding:</b>
              <br>
              We researched online on <u>key factors that affects people's favourability</u> of a place to live and work in.
              My team and I decided to focus of these aspects/problem statements:
              <ul>
                <li>Damian(Leader): Singapore is a Very Safe Country</li>
                <li>Natelie: Singapore has a Good Education System</li>
                <li>Javerine: Singapore has Good Housing.</li>
                <li>Amber(Myself): Singapore has a Good Healthcare System</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <p style="padding-bottom: 0px">
              <b>Interview:</b>
              <br>
              Crafted interview questions regarding my problem statement to <u>gather user requirements using user story</u>. 
              My team and I included a global interview question: "If you could create a country, what would it be like?", which gave our interviewees an unrestricted space to share their dreams and desires, enabling us to <u>gather
              perspectives that we might have otherwise missed</u>. After we had finished interviewing, we created <u>personas</u> with a summary of each of the interviews, which we <u>used to create user stories</u>. 
              <br>
              <img src="../resources/persona.png" alt="persona" class="srm-header">
              <br><br>
              <b>Data Preparation:</b>
              <br>
              Sourced datasets from <u>reliable government statistical sites</u> like moh.gov.sg, SingStat, etc. From the user stories, they brought up 3 main points, <u>Quality, Cost, and Efficiency</u>, hence, I decided to focus on these points.
              Additionally, I tried to used data that had <u>at least 10 years of data</u> and the <u>most recent year being at least 2019</u> so that I can analyse the trend and where Singapore's Healthcare currently stands. 
              <br><br>After downloading all the datasets, I categorised them by their factor and started to clean the data:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Replace "na" with 0</li>
                <li>Remove empty columns</li>
                <li>Rename columns</li>
                <li>Transpose the tables</li>
              </ul><br>

              <p style="padding-bottom: 0px">
              <b>Data Visualisation:</b><br>
              Each factor (Quality, Cost, Efficiency) had their <u>own report page to easily view and identify each factor</u>. A <u>variety of visualisation types</u> was used to best present the data. The finalised the reports underwent multiple iterations, each given to my team mates and past interviewees to interact with, before
              <u>constructive feedback</u> was given to improve it. I included slicers to allow user to <u>filter the report</u> according to their own preferences.
              <br><br>
              <b>Statistical Modelling:</b><br>
              Usage of linear regression, forecast and decomposition tree made it <u>easier to anaylse the trend</u> and results of the chosen data.
              </p>
            </p>
          <h4>Outcome & Results Achieved</h4>
          <p>Overall, Singapore Visuals suggest that its healthcare system has established itself by ensuring it was <u>equitable, efficient and ever-improving</u>. Its variety of healthcare options and subsidies ensures that <u>everyone regardless
            of income or social standing can get medical attention</u>. Therefore, I <b><u>support that Singapore has a good healthcare system</u></b>.
